## Rustbot
A discord bot that is built using python and the discord.py library. Not intended for commerical nor mass usage. Just a personal project of mine to practice and learn python.

### Commands
#### r!hello
Bot says "Hello, World!".

#### r!inspire
Bot says a random quote from Zenquotes.io.

#### r!cat 1-9
Bot posts a random cat from cataas.com up to 9 times.

#### r!guess
Bot picks a random number from 1 to 10. User must then guess the number. Failure to do so within 20 seconds results to the command being aborted.
